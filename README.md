# ArduSlidr
Simple Arduino camera dolly slider using the AccelSepper
The aim of this project is to make a single axis linear motion control system using Arduino and a NEMA stepper motor.

You'll need to add the AccelStepper Library to your Arduino IDE
You can download this from: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/

This is a work in progress as I learn to code in Arduino.
